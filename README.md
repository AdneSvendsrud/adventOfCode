? stars, ended on day ?

This year I decided to do AoC properly, using python and include comments in my code.

## 2021

16 stars, ended on day 10.

I wanted to solve this year's AoC using javascript, I ended up writing a lot of weird code, including how to run my solutions.

I used react simplified (which I do not like) because that was what we used at school, I later learned that this was a weird simplification of react made by my lecturer.

The solutions here are not the prettiest, but they work. I think I limited myself and got discouraged when I couldn't solve day 5, 11 and 13. So I stopped there

## 2019

5 stars, ended on day 4.

I started coding in the summer of 2019, so this was my first AoC, solved using python.
